      <p>Zealous Blog</p>
      <p>February 19, 2014</p>
      <p>We spoke with Molly Walsh, the store manager at 826CHI, to learn more about this great organization. 826CHI is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting students ages 6 to 18 with their creative and expository writing skills, and to helping teachers inspire their students to write. I imagine it as the place where cool creative kids become even cooler and more creative.</p>
