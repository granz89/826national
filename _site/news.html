    <h2>VOLUNTEER SPOTLIGHT: JENI CRONE</h2>
      <p>
        How did you first got involved with 826CHI? <br><br> At the beginning of my final year of art school I dropped a class on the Global Economy and decided to look for an internship that engaged my interest in education. I had always planned on becoming a teacher, but had made a decision to hold off an an Ed degree in undergrad in favor of focusing on my own education. Before a Google search for "creative writing education internship Chicago" I had never heard of 826. When I started I was thinking of it as "just an internship." I slowly fell in love, but never would have guessed how important 826 would become in my life.

    <h2>ROBIN WILLIAMS, SUPPORTER OF YOUTH LITERACY</h2>
      <p>
        We at the 826 family are devastated to hear about the death of Robin Williams. Early in the days of 826 Valencia, Robin sponsored one of our first Young Authors' Book Projects -- and did so in a way only Robin Williams could. He visited Galileo Academy of Science and Technology, a public high school in San Francisco, to inspire their students to write essays on the theme of "home," and he not only talked about the importance of hard work in the process of self-expression, but he put on a show! The students were thrilled, laughed till they cried, and were thoroughly inspired. From Robin's visit and inspirational words came the book Home Wasn't Built in a Day, a riveting, beautifully written collection of student writing that has sold thousands of copies and gave these students a profound sense of accomplishment, self-worth, and the uniquely empowering knowledge that they were heard. The students were amazed that someone of Robin's stature -- and stature in the Bay Area in particular -- would visit their school, and so fully support their writing -- he even paid the print bill! He wrote a wonderful essay to accompany the book, and that essay can be read below. We wish peace to Robin's family and hope that the world will remember Robin Williams as not only a once-in-millenium talent, but one of the world's most generous and big-hearted citizens.

    <h2>HOME WASN'T BUILT IN A DAY, FOREWORD BY ROBIN WILLIAMS</h2>
      <p>
        Family stories are a strange concoctionâ€”a blend of autobiography, fiction, and sense memory served up by your favorite relatives and seasoned by time, cultural background, and shared experience.
My mother told me stories of being a teenager in 1930s New Orleans, a world of gay weddings and an artist who had a gorilla as a pet (the gorilla later tried to kill the artist because he fancied his girlfriend). It was a time of jazz funerals and love-me potions dispensed by women with faux-French names, big feathered hats, and monkey-fur accessories.
