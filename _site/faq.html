    HOW DID 826 NATIONAL START?
  </label>
  <div class="answers">
    826's first chapter, 826 Valencia, opened its doors in San Francisco's Mission District in 2002. Author Dave Eggers and award-winning educator Nínive Calegari co-founded 826 Valencia as a place where students, parents, and families from the under-resourced schools nearby could access after-school tutoring, workshops, field trips, and writing programs, all for free. Soon after, 826NYC and 826LA opened their doors in Brooklyn and Mar Vista to offer the same programs in their communities. Due to the popularity of the model and the opening of four additional chapters, Eggers and Calegari then co-founded 826 National in 2008 to support the seven existing chapters and manage the opening of future chapters.

    WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE AN 826 CHAPTER?
  </label>
  <div class="answers">
   Chapters of 826 National are bound by a chapter affiliation agreement that defines the relationship between the chapter and 826 National, outlines 826 National’s standards, and also lists specifically which programs an 826 chapter must offer. Only official chapters are allowed to use the 826 name.

    CAN WE USE THE 826 NAME EITHER DURING OUR PLANNING PROCESS OR AS A PART OF THE NAME FOR OUR POTENTIAL ORGANIZATION?
  </label>
  <div class="answers">
    The 826 name can only be used by official chapters, such as 826NYC and 826CHI. It cannot be used as a “place holder” name for individuals meeting to discuss a particular community’s needs or proposed projects. 826 is a registered trademark and the use of names and logos are limited to chapters. If you have started a new writing or tutoring center in your community, please avoid group names such as 826 San Francisco and substitute San Francisco Writing Center or something unique and creative instead. However, feel free to refer to your exploration and plans as inspired by 826 Valencia or other nonprofits that move you to make a difference in your community. Don’t hesitate to reach out to us to let us know what your organization is doing. We’re always happy to hear from other educators and writers!

    HOW DO YOU TRAIN YOUR VOLUNTEERS?
  </label>
  <div class="answers">
    Every chapter offers trainings for its volunteers that are tailored to each program:
For after-school tutoring, volunteers learn best practices for tutoring students, including keeping students inspired, tackling tough assignments, getting homework finished, and forging a positive bond.
Trainings for tutoring English Language Learners focus on learning techniques and tools for how to meet the more complex needs of those students who are learning English as a second language.
For field trips, volunteers learn best practices for working with a full class, fielding difficult questions or suggestions, drawing out quiet students, and keeping the fun and productive.
In Workshop Teacher Trainings, volunteers develop new workshops, refine class schedules and goals, rework rough drafts of lesson plans, and receive general tips for teaching.
For the Young Authors’ Book Project trainings, volunteers learn the ins and outs of 826 book projects. From tips for working with students one-on-one to helping students edit their writing, to what to do with questionable material that students write.
And in College Essay Writing trainings, volunteers benefit from the experience and expertise of college admissions directors who read and select essays, and leave with the tools they need to help high school students face the most intimidating essay they’ve ever written.
