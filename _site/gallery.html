	  <h3>AMAZING 826 SERIAL STORYTELLING EXTRAVAGANZA!</h3>
<p>826CHI recently received a donation of Moleskine notebooks, each of which contain eight pages. In contemplating the special number of eight, it only made sense to introduce a new 826 chapter-wide serial storytelling project. Over the course of this spring, we are circulating 12 of these notebooks through all eight of our chapters across the country, asking students to write one page apiece. At the conclusion of the multi-chapter, multi-state project, we will have 12 separate stories, each written by eight student authors.</p>

<p>While much of the information at 826CHI is (understandably) classified, word has leaked that: At each chapter, students will include a nod to something in their city and/or their chapter’s storefront in their writing. Or maybe not. We are quite confident, however, that the resulting stories and author bios will be entertaining, enlightening, and one-of-a-kind. Which is why we we've redesigned this part of 826 National's website to spotlight and celebrate these 96 student authors. Read on and enjoy!</p>

    CYBORG INVASION
  </label>
  <div class="answers">
    It was a foggy day. It was Monday. There was a secret agent named Double Agent Christopher otherwise known as Chris. He woke up at 7:00 all sleepy and he went to take a shower. He got dressed and brushed his teeth. After he finished his homework he decided to watch the big game of basketball. It was the Miami Heat vs. Boston Celtics but in the middle he saw that one of the players had a cyborg eye! He zoomed in and it was a cyborg! He called the headquarters. The headquarters sent him on a mission. He needed to wear a tuxedo and he needed to find a way to get to the next game but he remembered they were doing a visitor game in Chicago in his very own school. It was Bulls vs. Lakers. That would be a great time. He pulled the fire alarm and he fought the Los Angeles Lakers. He defeated them but he got injured a lot. He went to the big boss and he said, “Why do you want to rule our world?” The boss said, “We need to increase the cyborg race.” Chris defeated the big boss but the boss said, “there is a big traitor from the headquarters and he will help us rule the world.”

<br><br>

Christopher scoffingly walked away, brushing cyborg dust from his secret agent suit. “Dumb cyborg. The world is ours and ours alone,” he said. He called his friend Nick, or “Goose”, and they celebrated the defeat of the cyborgs at a basketball game.

<br><br>

Eight months later, Christopher was sitting down to his usual breakfast of six eggs and twelve strips of bacon. He heard the shattering of glass. “What are you doing here, Goose?”he exclaimed. Goose said nothing and lunged at Christopher. Not knowing what else to do, he threw the glass of water from his breakfast at Goose’s face. Goose started twitching and emitting a buzzing sound. Christopher realized - the cyborgs were back….and one of them was his best friend.


<br><br>

Goose collapsed on the floor, but his arms kept moving! He was still alive! Chris wasn’t sure what to do. His best friend was a cyborg! Cyborg or not, Goose was still his best friend.
<br><br>
Chris decided to go to Headquarters to create some gadgets to fight the cyborgs and help his friend. The first gadget he made was called the “Cyborg Detector 5000”. The “Cyborg Detector 5000” looks like a regular pair of glasses, except that there is a button on the right side, which when pushed allows the wearer to scan people and tell if they are cyborgs or humans. The second gadget injects a cyborg antidote into cyborgs and turns them back into humans. The second gadget was called the “Cyborg Cure.”
<br><br>
After creating the gadgets, Chris headed back to school to use his “Cyborg Detector 5000” glasses, but the cyborgs were able to scan Chris’ glasses and realized that he was a spy! One of the cyborgs (his name was Jeff) yelled “Get him!” and all the cyborgs ran after Chris.
<br><br>
Chris came to a dead end. He had to fight the cyborgs. He put one in a headlock and gave another a noogie. “Ouch!” He threw the cyborg in the headlock into the remaining cyborgs. This gave Chris the chance to escape.
<br><br>
Quickly, Chris ran home with the antidote to cure his friend, Goose. Chris injected the antidote into Goose’s arm. Goose opened his eyes and just as he was saying, “Thank you” giant footsteps outside the door interrupted him. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

<br><br>
Then Chris opened the door. But it … it ... it … was a taco man from taco place. “Oh no!,” Chris said. Then the cyborg troopers knocked Chris in the head. “Nooo,” said the Goose. Then suddenly …

Far, Far away, the Battle of Freedom Galaxy war vs. Robot Aliens. Then N and the others luckily escaped from the battle and into a portal going to Chris’s house. “Who are you?” asked N. “Who are you?” asked Goose. “I am N sworn to protect the Galaxy,” said N. Then a mutant, rock, water, ice, lava, acid and all the master of matter showed up. “Oh snap!” said N and Keniloo said unknowing. “Well, this is war between the light side & dark side … ”


<br><br>

Chris, Goose, N and Keniloo started a meeting, talking about how to bring down the cyborgs. Chris says, “Let’s stop arguing. We can and must get into the Robot Alien/Cyborg computer brain and shut them down.” Goose replied, “How are we going to do that?” Keniloo suggested, “I know someone, my uncle’s cousin, who can help us hack into their brains and shut them down!” N states, “Okay, now more suggestions, I already chose Keniloo’s plan. Keniloo, go get your uncle’s cousin and meet here at 7pm tomorrow night. Everyone else, get your computers set up here and be ready for tomorrow!” The gang could meet the next day as planned or go to Chris’ secret lair…!

<br><br>
Later, Chris and Kenilo and his army came and prepared for the battle. It was Wednesday, 2099 9:00 AM. The plan is that we’re gonna go outside and do a sneak attack. Boom! Bang! They’re here! Who’s here? The alien robots. Ready team, attack!

“We did it!”

“No, we did!”

And then a dragon came out of nowhere, grabbed me by its tail, and choked me.

<br><br>

Though this may seem like the end of a long story that was written by authors all over the USA, the story of Chris and his friends will be remembered.

    RAPHAEL
  </label>
  <div class="answers">
    Raphael is a 23 year old. He is average height and he has brown hair. He is strong and skinny. He has blue eyes and glasses. He studies art. He lives close to school and he has a dog named Max. He lives in New York. He also has the power of invisibility. Also, his dog turns invisible at the same time as Raphael. Every day, Raphael rides his skateboard to school, but everybody can only see his skate board, No one reacts to it because they think it is the wind.


<br><br>

One day, they were going to an art fair. After being invisible to sneak in for free, he snapped his fingers twice to turn back to normal. But he didn’t see Max! He was terrified! He looked around frantically. A scientist noticed Raphael was searching for something and he said “What are you looking for?” Raphael explained how he lost his dog. The scientist replied, “My name is Dr. Dufensmirk and I have heard of a potion that can cure your dog. It contains, salt, vinegar, blue paint, fly guts, beef jerky, and cookies & cream ice cream.” “Where is it?” Raphael asked. “In a safe in the center of the planet,” responded Dr. Dufensmirk.


<br><br>

Raphael decides to go to the planet named Mystery Planet. He’s going crazy trying to find the potion. He meets aliens that are ugly and stupid and walk into poles and kick each other. Raphael walks into a trap. There is water, and when he gets out of the water, the aliens throw food at him. It’s hard to find all the ingredients for the potion. When the aliens are asleep, he cuts open the trap he fell into, and he falls into a hole. Dr. Dufensmirk is there and they find all the ingredients. They go home and find the dog. They have a party with the aliens they meet. They go home and find the dog, but Raphael made a mistake and accidentally traveled to Jupiter!


<br><br>

Jupiter is made of pie! Raphael walked a few steps and noticed that he was on a pie. He saw a hole filled with blueberries so he ran to swim in it, but he ate it instead. Then he noticed two portals. The white portal said “New York”, and the green portal said “ZOMBIA.” He tried to go through the New York portal, but it was too late. The green portal sucked him in. He said to himself, “Don’t drop that Dunkin Donut … don’t drop that Dunkin Donut …” 1000 minutes later, Raphael was in Zombia, where he saw another portal empire that said “New York” but an empire was in front of it. Raphael did not know that his dog, Max, went to Zombia before he got there. Max went into the empire and the king gave Max a potion that turned him evil.

<br><br>


Max goes after Raphael and tries to destroy him. Max searches high and low but is unable to find Raphael. Raphael was hiding in a “ Target store” - the biggest store in Zombia. Max starts searching in Target for Raphael. Raphael sees Max and ties to hide under a blanket. But he realizes it is not a very good hiding place and tries to leave the store. Meanwhile, Max continues searching for Raphael but is unsuccessful. Raphael finds a house that has been built in which he hides. Before long, Max finds the house and tries to enter but cannot figure out how. He looks in through the window and sees Raphael. A man opens the door to the house and accidentally lets Max in! Raphael panics, he is cornered. He has two options, he could go to the ice-cream store nearby to hide or he could try to get back home and find a way to save Max.

<br><br>

First, he thought I should go to the ice cream store instead. As he headed for the store, he saw his favorite ice cream: butterscotch-caramel-vanilla. He couldn’t help himself so he ordered a 3-scooop ice cream. Once he paid for his ice cream he saw max around the corner and headed towards him. Quickly, Raphael froze because he knew that he was dead but remembered that Max cannot resist ice cream either. So, carefully, Raphael put his 3-scoop ice cream on the ground. To his surprise, Max stopped and started to lick it but that that same moment something amazing happened.

<br><br>
Then Max went up to space without a helmet or spacesuit, but he could still fly. He kicked the moon. He found that it was made of cheese, so he ate it. Then he ate the stars, before falling back to earth where he grew wings.

    SUMMERTIME ALIEN
  </label>
  <div class="answers">
   On a 70° summer morning Louis walks out of his house and runs past Lincoln Park. He sees wind blowing on trees and sees a kid falling from a tree. He took out his phone and caught the kid on camera. Then he put his phone back into the pockets of his sports shorts. But he gets in an accident himself. He trips on the laces of his shoes and scrapes his knees. He gets up, tries to get through the pain and keeps going.

He gets to his friends house, his friend (Michigan) asks, “What happened to your knees?”

He answers, “I tripped.”

Michigan then calls his mom and tells her Louis tripped. Michigan’s mom tells them she can help, and takes Louis to the bathroom to clean up his knees. She tells Louis, “This used to happen to me when I was your age in Jupiter.”

He answers, “You’re lucky to grow up in Florida, Chicago is great but winters are tough.” She says, “Yeah, sure.”

Then Michigan says, “Mom, you should say what happened during winter break and that we accidently went to Mars instead of Jupiter.


Louis was confused. Was Jupiter a city in Florida, or was Mars? Weren’t they planets?

“That’s the thing Louis…”, said Massachusetts, Michigan’s mother. “You’re going to need to come with us.”

“No way!” exclaimed Louis. “You’re crazy if you think I’m going to follow two aliens anywhere.”

“Fine, have it your way” said Massachusetts.

Suddenly a beam shot out of her eye and seemed to freeze Louis to the spot. Hours later, Louis woke up. He was floating through space, and he had a killer headache.

Just then, a door burst open and someone, or something, walked into the room. “Glad to see you’re awake Louis,” said the thing. “Sorry for the rough entrance.”

“My knees hurt,” he replied.

“We need to talk,” the thing said. “I’m with the Intergalactic Alliance to Rid the Universe of Mean Folks.”


Louis tried to prove he was a good person. He was going to cook dinner. He was going to treat the thing with respect. But Louis was also going to defend himself from the thing.

He had a plan to escape so he got a pan and whacked Massachusetts on the head. He picked up the pan and then ran and whacked Michigan over the head, too. He jumped on the sofa and out the window and called the cops.

“We’ll be right there. Don’t move,” said the cop’s voice. But something in the voice was not trustworthy.


When the cop got into the thing’s house the lights turned off right away. When the lights came on the cop became a skeleton! All of a sudden Johnny and Jack (powerful secret spies) arrived. Johnny took a picture of the skeleton with his iphone because the picture would provide evidence of how the cop became a skeleton.

Jack and Johnny broke into Michigan’s house and found Michigan and Massachusetts tied up. Then when Johnny and Jack got to their house, they took Michigan and Massachusetts to New York.

When they got to New York Johnny and Jack put sleeping potion on Michigan and Massachusetts . To Michigan and Massachusetts surprise, when they woke up they found themselves in jail. And not just any jail, Alien Jail— which like all awesome things happens to be in New York.


Louis had a decision to make. Should he keep Massachusetts and Michigan in jail or let them go? He decided to let both of them go free because Michigan was his friend and Massachusetts was his friend’s mom. He was not happy that they froze him and turned the cop into a skeleton, but he forgave them. Louis was still afraid of Michigan and Massachusetts, so he went away to Washington, D.C. and started going to school there at Harriet Tubman Elementary School. Louis writes a paper about the packet of word stations. DC-CAS ended and Louis went to the store. At the store, he saw Michigan and Massachusetts! Louis could go home and do his homework or he could invite Michigan and Massachusetts to write with him….


They want to write with him but Michigan wants to play baseball because he thinks writing is stupid.


But then Michigan realizes that writing is the best thing he’s ever done in his entire life. He finds out that he has the powers to write the best books, newspaper articles, and anything else that has to do with writing ever (in the entire world). When Massachusetts heard that Michigan had started to like writing she was excited because she had been trying to get Michigan to start writing for a while now.

Unfortunately, after this happened, a giant spider-pig flew out of the sky and...


“AAAAAAA” it squished them and they died! The End.
